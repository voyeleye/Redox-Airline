## Introduction
This is a dummy dataset on a small startup airline operating out of the Chicago, Illinois, area in the United States. The airline's management team has a strong airline operations background, but donâ€™t have much financial or data analytics experience. Many of their systems are disparate and not connected. I was shocked to find out that until just recently, the airline could not pull specific aircraft details, such as route and seating capacity, from a single report, but rather needed to open two or more files and compare the information. I am analyzing the data to present key insights to drive the business growth and position in the industry.

## Problem Statement
1. How many flights use the A319 aircraft?
2. What is the most common type of aircraft across all flights?
3. What is the maximum average ticket price for flights on the A320 aircraft?
4. Show the fuel cost per mile in Dollars
5. Show the total revenue per flight, assuming a 10% tax on all fares 
6. Where are we losing the most money?
7. Where are we most profitable?
8. How many flights are flown from O'Hare (ORD) to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)?
9. Which route accounts for the lowest percentage of total revenue? 10. What was the most popular month to fly to Fort Lauderdale (FLL)?
11. How many flights per month are on the ORD-PHL route?

## Recommendation
Given that A320 was the least profitable aircraft, Redox Airline may consider reassessing its usage. If possible, by allocating A320 to routes with higher demand or adjust pricing strategies to improve its profitability. Conversely, as B737 was the most profitable aircraft, more opportunities to increase its deployment on high-demand routes can be explored.
The performance of specific routes can be evaluated, especially focusing on the ORD-SLC route, which contributed the lowest percentage of total revenue. Redox Airline may consider adjusting the frequency or pricing strategies for underperforming routes to maximize profitability.
Redox Airline may recognize the popularity of certain months, such as June for flights to Fort Lauderdale and November for the ORD-PHL route; and align marketing and pricing strategies to capitalize on these peak periods, potentially offering promotions or incentives to attract more passengers
